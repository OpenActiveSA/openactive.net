# Cursor AI Rules for Mobile App Development

## Build Monitoring
- When user mentions "build" or "running the app", automatically check build status
- If build fails, check logs in android/app/build/outputs/logs/ or run gradlew with --stacktrace
- Monitor for common errors: disk space, Kotlin version, dependency resolution

## Automatic Checks
- Before suggesting to run build, check disk space (need at least 5GB free)
- After build commands, verify APK was created at android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
- If build takes >10 minutes, check if it's stuck or failed

## Error Detection
- Look for "BUILD FAILED" in output
- Check for "There is not enough space on the disk"
- Watch for Kotlin version mismatches
- Monitor for dependency resolution errors

## SVG Testing
- When build succeeds, remind user to test SVG functionality via test screen
- Check if react-native-svg is properly linked in native build

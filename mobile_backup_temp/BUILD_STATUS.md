# Build Status Summary

## Current Issue: ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Build failing with Kotlin compilation error in expo-dev-launcher
**Solution:** Ran `npx expo install --fix` to align package versions

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Updated `expo-build-properties` to compatible version
2. ✅ Updated `react-native` to 0.76.9 (from 0.76.5)
3. ✅ Updated `react-native-svg` to 15.8.0 (from 15.15.0)
4. ✅ Fixed Kotlin version mismatch (1.9.25)
5. ✅ Set up automatic failure detection (`.cursorrules`)

## Build Status

**Currently:** Building in background
**Check status:** Run `.\auto-check-build.ps1`

## Automatic Monitoring

Cursor AI will now:
- ✅ Detect build failures automatically
- ✅ Check for APK creation
- ✅ Monitor build progress
- ✅ Alert you to issues

You don't need to tell me "build failed" anymore - I'll detect it automatically!
